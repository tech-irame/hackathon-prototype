# Collaborator Guide — hackathon-prototype

Multiple pods (teams) work on this repo in parallel, each from their own
Claude Code CLI session, pushing directly to `main`. The risks are NOT
technical (this is a mocked-data demo) — the risks are **stepping on each
other's design**, **building the same thing twice**, and **breaking the
shared user flow**. The Claude preflight catches all three before you push.

This guide is also designed to be pasted into a fresh Claude Code session —
see the [Appendix](#appendix--paste-this-into-a-fresh-claude-code-session).

---

## 1. What this repo is

- **Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite. Frontend-only, all data mocked in `src/data/mockData.ts`.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/tech-irame/hackathon-prototype
- **Live URL:** https://hackathon-demo-ujihgyhrpa-uc.a.run.app
- **Branch model:** **direct push to `main`**. Every push auto-deploys to Cloud Run in ~2 min.
- **Don't touch:** the production stack at `auditify.platform.irame.ai`.

---

## 2. One-time setup

### 2.1 Tools

```bash
# macOS
brew install git gh node@22

# Claude Code CLI (required for the preflight review)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude --version

# Auth Claude CLI to your account (one-time)
claude          # opens browser to log in
```

### 2.2 GitHub access

```bash
gh auth login                    # GitHub.com → HTTPS → browser
gh auth status                   # confirm
```

You need write access to `tech-irame/hackathon-prototype`. Ask the repo owner if `git push` is rejected.

### 2.3 Clone and bootstrap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tech-irame/hackathon-prototype.git
cd hackathon-prototype
npm install
npm run setup-hooks         # ★ enables the Claude preflight on git push
```

`setup-hooks` configures `core.hooksPath=.githooks` so the pre-push hook runs
the preflight every time you `git push`. Run it once per clone.

### 2.4 Run locally

```bash
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173
npm run build        # production build → dist/
npm run lint
```

### 3.2 The preflight, in detail

When you `git push`, the hook runs `tools/preflight-review.sh`, which does
three things in order:

**Step 1 — auto-rebase.** Fetches `<remote>/main` and, if your local main is
behind, runs `git pull --rebase --autostash` to stack your work on top of
whatever other pods pushed. If the rebase is clean, the script keeps going.
If the rebase hits a conflict, the script aborts the push with instructions:
resolve the markers, `git add`, `git rebase --continue`, then `git push` again.

**Step 2 — multi-page hard-review gate.** Every sidebar nav entry counts as
one **page**. If your push touches **2+ pages**, the script BLOCKS and asks
for a one-line reason before continuing. This catches the single biggest
cause of pod friction: one team's "cleanup" silently breaks another team's
page (dropped columns, moved tabs, restyled shared components, etc.).

The pages the script recognizes (mapped from `src/components/` paths):

| Page | Sourced from |
|---|---|
| Ask IRA | `chat/` |
| Home | `home/` |
| Recents | `recents/` |
| Planning | `audit/AuditPlanning*`, `audit/AuditExecution*` |
| Process Hub | `audit/BusinessProcesses*` |
| Risk Register | `audit/RiskRegister*` |
| Control Library | `governance/`, `execution/` |
| Dashboard | `dashboard/` |
| Report | `reports/` |
| Workflow Library | `workflow/` |
| AI Concierge | `intelligence/`, `concierge-workflow-builder/` |
| Knowledge Hub | `knowledge/`, `data-sources/` |
| Admin | `admin/` |

Everything else (`shared/`, `sidebar/`, `modals/`, `artifacts/`, `hooks/`,
`data/`, `index.css`, `App.tsx`, configs) is treated as a **shared surface**
— it's still reviewed, but does NOT count toward the page total. So a
single-page polish commit that also tweaks `shared/StatusBadge.tsx` still
counts as one page.

When the gate fires you'll see:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  ⚠  MULTI-PAGE PUSH — hard review required (3 pages)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  • AI Concierge
      src/components/concierge-workflow-builder/GuideMeModal.tsx
  • Report
      src/components/reports/ReportsView.tsx
  • Workflow Library
      src/components/workflow/WorkflowTemplates.tsx

This push touches 2+ pages — exactly the kind of change that silently
breaks another pod's work …

To continue, type:   YES <one-line reason>
  e.g.   YES global typography sweep — coordinated with design

Proceed?
```

Type `YES <reason>`. Anything else aborts the push. The reason is forwarded
to the Claude reviewer so it can judge whether every affected page really
matches your stated intent (and flag collateral-damage pages).

If you can't prompt interactively (CI, scripts, agents), set:

```bash
MULTI_PAGE_OK="<one-line reason>" git push
```

`MULTI_PAGE_OK` must be a **non-empty** string — an empty value does not
bypass the gate.

**Step 3 — Claude review.** Calls the Claude CLI with a prompt focused on
**three axes only**:

1. **Design conflicts** — new colors / typography / spacing / card patterns
   that contradict the established bento + charcoal + purple-accent system.
2. **Feature redundancy** — building something already in `src/`. Two views
   for the same job, parallel mock-data shapes for the same entity, duplicate
   component logic.
3. **UX / flow gaps** — dead-end states, broken back button, "two screens
   with the same name doing different things", CTAs that lead nowhere.

For **multi-page** pushes (after the Step 2 gate), the Claude reviewer uses
a **stricter rubric** that additionally demands:

- A per-page **Added / Modified / Dropped** list (user-visible language only
  — no code, no class names, no LOC counts).
- An explicit **cross-page conflicts** section (same pattern diverging
  across two pages, moved features without redirects, global CSS that
  unintentionally restyles a page you didn't mention, dropped elements still
  linked from elsewhere, etc.).
- An **intent check** against the `YES <reason>` you typed: every affected
  page is marked ✓ (matches reason), ⚠  (looks like collateral damage),
  or 🚨 (contradicts the reason).
- A final **verdict**: ✅ Coordinated · ⚠  Mixed · 🚨 HARD STOP recommended.

**Explicitly NOT raised** (both rubrics): perf, scaling, type-nits, tests,
"best practices", refactor suggestions, accessibility-unless-broken, security.
This is a demo.

The output appears directly in your terminal. For single-page pushes the
review is **advisory only** (push always proceeds). For multi-page pushes
the Step 2 gate is a hard block, but the Step 3 review remains advisory —
if the reviewer returns 🚨 HARD STOP RECOMMENDED, it's on you to abort and
fix, or to push anyway with `SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1` on the next attempt.

### 3.3 Skipping the preflight

For a doc-only commit or an emergency fix (skips **all three steps** —
rebase, multi-page gate, and Claude review — you become responsible for
rebasing yourself):

```bash
SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1 git push
```

Bypass **only** the multi-page gate (still rebases + runs the stricter
Claude review) — useful for planned coordinated sweeps:

```bash
MULTI_PAGE_OK="editorial token sweep — coordinated in #hackathon-pod" git push
```

Or run the Claude review on demand without pushing (no rebase, no gate):

```bash
npm run review:local
```

### 3.4 Daily commands

```bash
# pull latest
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# work locally — your Claude CLI does the editing
# ... commits with `git commit -m "feat: ..."` ...

# push (preflight runs automatically)
git push
```

That's the whole flow. **No PRs, no branches, no waiting** — just commit + push.
Pods that want extra eyes can still open a PR (see §4) and the same review
runs there as a comment.

### 3.5 Commit style

Short imperative subject, optional body explaining *why* (not *what* — the diff
shows what):

```
feat: add risk register inline filter chip
fix: sidebar collapse no longer hides the Settings link
chore: bump rive-app to 4.27.3
docs: clarify preflight skip in CONTRIBUTING
```

Prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`.

---

## 4. Optional: opening a PR

You don't need to, but if you want a second opinion before merging:

```bash
git checkout -b your-name/short-description
# ... commits ...
git push -u origin HEAD
gh pr create --fill
```

The same Claude review runs as a PR comment via `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`.
Merging the PR to `main` triggers the deploy.

You can re-run the review on a PR by commenting `@claude` in the PR thread.

---

## 5. The pipeline files

| File | Purpose | Triggers when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/preflight-review.sh` | Auto-rebase onto remote main, gate multi-page pushes behind a typed-reason prompt (or `MULTI_PAGE_OK=...`), then run the focused Claude review (design / redundancy / UX — strict rubric when multi-page). Aborts on rebase conflict, aborts if a multi-page push has no reason. | You run `git push` (after `npm run setup-hooks`) — or `npm run review:local` (review only, no rebase, no gate) |
| `.githooks/pre-push` | Calls the preflight from git's hook system | Same |
| `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` | Build Docker → push to Artifact Registry → deploy to Cloud Run. **`cancel-in-progress: true`** so a newer push kills any in-flight older build — the live revision always matches the latest tip of main. | Push to `main` |
| `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` | Same focused review, posted as PR comment | PR opened / `@claude` comment |
| `cloudbuild.yaml` | Manual `gcloud builds submit` config (not used by CI) | Only if you run it explicitly |
| `Dockerfile` + `nginx.conf` | Multi-stage node:22-alpine → nginx:alpine on :8080 | Used by deploy and cloudbuild |

### 5.1 Auth model (FYI, you don't need to touch it)

GitHub Actions auths to GCP via **Workload Identity Federation** — no service
account keys exist anywhere. Only repos under `tech-irame` can use the
deploy SA `gh-actions-deploy@gen-lang-client-0250661731.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

The Claude PR reviewer auths via the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` repo secret.

---

## 6. Verifying / debugging

```bash
# what's the latest deploy doing?
gh run list --repo tech-irame/hackathon-prototype --limit 5
gh run watch --repo tech-irame/hackathon-prototype

# is the live site up?
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" https://hackathon-demo-ujihgyhrpa-uc.a.run.app/

# (requires gcloud) what revision is live?
gcloud run services describe hackathon-demo \
  --region us-central1 --project gen-lang-client-0250661731 \
  --format="value(status.latestReadyRevisionName,spec.template.spec.containers[0].image)"
```

Roll back via Cloud Run revisions:

```bash
gcloud run revisions list --service=hackathon-demo --region=us-central1 --project=gen-lang-client-0250661731
gcloud run services update-traffic hackathon-demo \
  --to-revisions=hackathon-demo-00001-xyz=100 \
  --region=us-central1 --project=gen-lang-client-0250661731
```

## 7. Common gotchas

- **You skipped `npm run setup-hooks`.** No preflight ran on your push. Re-run it once per clone.
- **Don't commit `node_modules/`, `dist/`, or `.serena/`.** All in `.gitignore`. Use `git add <specific files>`, not `git add .`.
- **Don't add real API keys.** Mocked-data demo only. No `.env`, no secrets.
- **The deploy auto-fires on every main push, including doc-only changes.** That's fine (Docker build is fast and cached) but be aware. If two pushes race, the older deploy is **cancelled mid-flight** so the newest commit wins.
- **Two pods edit the same file → real git merge conflict.** The preflight tries to rebase you onto remote main automatically. If the rebase is clean, your push proceeds. If it conflicts, the push aborts with a message telling you to fix the markers, `git add`, `git rebase --continue`, then `git push` again (the hook runs once more on the merged result). To bail: `git rebase --abort`.
- **Preflight told you about a conflict — what now?** Talk to the other pod in your team channel before fixing forward. The whole point of the review is to surface coordination issues you'd otherwise discover at demo time.
- **Multi-page push got blocked.** You touched 2+ sidebar pages in one push and didn't supply a reason. Type `YES <one-line reason>` at the prompt, or re-push with `MULTI_PAGE_OK="<reason>" git push`. If you honestly don't have a cross-page reason, that's the signal — split the push into per-page commits. See §3.2 for the page list.
- **Multi-page reviewer came back 🚨 HARD STOP.** The stricter Claude rubric thinks one of the pages you touched is collateral damage (you didn't mean to change it). Read the "Intent check" section of the output — it'll name the offending page and say what incidentally changed. Most common causes: global CSS / shared component change that restyled a page outside your stated reason, or a file you opened in the editor and saved without meaningful edits.

Shared files (`shared/`, `sidebar/`, `modals/`, `hooks/`, CSS, configs) don't count toward the page total. **(3) Claude review** focused on **design conflicts**, **feature redundancy**, and **UX/flow gaps** — advisory only; never blocks the push.
