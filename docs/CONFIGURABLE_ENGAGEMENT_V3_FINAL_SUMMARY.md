## Reused Existing System Components

### Workflow Library BulkExecuteModal

- **Extracted** from `WorkflowLibraryView.tsx` (3,159 lines) into `BulkExecuteModal.tsx` (2,429 lines)
- **Existing Workflow Library**: unchanged, imports from extracted file
- **V3 integration**: Automation Runs tab opens BulkExecuteModal with V3 workflows mapped to `LibraryWorkflow` format
- **Flow**: Audit config -> Data source/mapping -> Execute -> Floating progress panel
- **On completion**: V3 creates + simulates a run via `simulateRun`, feeding V3 state

### ManageExceptionsView

- **Made prop-driven**: accepts optional `exceptions`, `onExceptionsChange`, `contextLabel`, `embedded` props
- **Existing standalone page**: unchanged, defaults to `GRC_EXCEPTIONS`
- **V3 integration**: Automation Cases tab embeds with `embedded=true`, V3 exceptions mapped via `exceptionAdapter.ts`
- **Sync**: Bulk classify changes sync back to V3 runs state through adapter round-trip
- **Embedded mode**: compact header, Action Hub hidden, no back-button chrome

### Design Principle

V3 Automation Project acts as the **engagement container**. Execution and exception/case management reuse existing system modules:

```
V3 Automation Project (container)
  ├── Workflow Library BulkExecuteModal (execution)
  └── ManageExceptionsView (exceptions/cases)
```

This avoids duplicating execution and case management UX inside V3.

## Key Implementation Files

### Core V3 Module

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `configurableEngagementTypes.ts` | Core types, pattern configs, enums |
| `engagementPatterns.ts` | Pattern metadata, workspace tabs |
| `configurableEngagementState.ts` | Validation, readiness helpers |
| `ConfigurableEngagementWizard.tsx` | 4-step creation wizard |
| `ConfigurableEngagementWorkspace.tsx` | Workspace shell, all business state |
| `PatternWorkspaceRenderer.tsx` | Routes 27+ tab IDs to components |
| `components/` | WorkspaceHeader, WorkspaceTabs, WorkspaceOverview |

### Pattern Files

| Pattern | Directory | Files |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Compliance | `patterns/compliance/` | 16 files (8 tabs + 8 data) |
| Internal Audit | `patterns/internal-audit/` | 18 files (10 tabs + 8 data) |
| Automation | `patterns/automation/` | 17 files (8 tabs + 8 data + adapter) |

### Reused System Files (modified)

|------|--------|
| `src/components/workflow/BulkExecuteModal.tsx` | Created (extracted from WorkflowLibraryView) |
| `src/components/workflow/WorkflowLibraryView.tsx` | Reduced 3,159 -> 728 lines |

## Known Prototype Limitations

1. **Local state only** — all state resets on page refresh. No backend persistence.
2. **No Process Hub integration** — dev-only preview route, not wired into sidebar or Process Hub.
3. **Individual review drawer non-sync** — drawer saves in ManageExceptionsView are visual-only (consistent behavior in both standalone and embedded).
4. **CRITICAL severity display** — displays as "High" in GRC view (GRC has no Critical level). CRITICAL is preserved on reverse sync.
5. **Activity timeline** — embedded exceptions view may show global mock activity data.
6. **BulkExecuteModal Step 2 data sources** — uses modal's own demo data set, not V3 input data sources.
7. **Instant simulation** — V3 `simulateRun` completes instantly while floating progress panel animates over seconds.
8. **Dead props** — `casesState`/`onUpdateCases` are passed to AutomationCasesTab but unused after ManageExceptionsView replacement.
9. **No real integrations** — no email sending, file upload to backend, scheduler execution, report export, or Case Management API.
10. **Mock data** — all workflow execution outputs and exceptions are simulated based on workflow name keyword matching.
11. **Report actions are placeholders** — Apply Template, Share, and Download buttons in the automation Reports tab are visual placeholders that show alerts. No real PDF/export functionality is connected.

## Intentionally Not Changed

- Existing Engagement V2 (not replaced)
- Existing New Engagement flow (not replaced)
- Process Hub (not integrated)
- Sidebar (unchanged)
- RACM (unchanged)
- Control Library (unchanged)
- Risk Register (unchanged)
- Existing Workflow Library behavior (preserved, BulkExecuteModal extracted only)
- Existing Manage Exceptions behavior (preserved, props added only)
- No backend APIs added
- No production routing beyond dev preview route

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **PR review** on `feature/configurable-engagement-v3` branch
2. **Merge** V3 as isolated dev-preview feature (no production flow change)
3. **Process Hub integration** — add "Create V3 Engagement" CTA behind feature flag, without replacing existing New Engagement flow
4. **Sidebar entry** — add V3 preview access to sidebar under feature flag
5. **Backend persistence** — engagement, pattern config, workspace state, run results
6. **Project-scoped data sources** — pipe V3 Input Data into BulkExecuteModal Step 2
7. **Full drawer sync** — make individual exception drawer saves update state
8. **Real scheduler** — connect Schedule tab to workflow scheduling infrastructure
9. **Real report export** — connect Reports to PDF/Excel generation
10. **Real Case Management integration** — sync V3 cases to existing Case Management module
11. **Role/permission integration** — auditor vs risk owner access control
12. **SOX/IFC/ICOFR RACM wizard** — resolve RACM version selector in compliance wizard

## Architecture Notes

### State Management

All business state is lifted to `ConfigurableEngagementWorkspace` and passed through `PatternWorkspaceRenderer` as props + callbacks. Tab components own only UI state (form inputs, expanded panels, modals). This ensures state persists across tab switches.

### Pattern Separation

Each pattern has its own directory under `patterns/` with data files (types, mock data, helpers) and tab files (React components). No pattern imports from another pattern's directory.

### Reuse Architecture

```
App.tsx
  └── ConfigurableEngagementWorkspace (state owner)
        └── PatternWorkspaceRenderer (tab router)
              ├── AutomationRunsTab
              │     └── BulkExecuteModal (from workflow library)
              ├── AutomationCasesTab
              │     └── ManageExceptionsView (from exceptions module)
              └── [other tabs own their UI]
```
